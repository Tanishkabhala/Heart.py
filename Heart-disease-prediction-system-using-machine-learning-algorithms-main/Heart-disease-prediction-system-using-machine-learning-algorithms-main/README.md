# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System-with-UI-using-machine-learning-algorithms

Heart disease can be managed effectively with a combination of lifestyle changes, medicine and, in some cases, surgery. With the right treatment, the symptoms of heart disease can be reduced 
and the functioning of the heart improved. The predicted results can be used to prevent and thus reduce cost for surgical treatment and other expensive. 

The overall objective of my work will be to predict accurately with few tests and attributes the presence of heart disease. Attributes considered form the primary basis for tests and give accurate results more or less. Many more input attributes can be taken but our goal is to predict with few attributes and faster efficiency the risk of having heart disease. Decisions are often made based on doctors’ intuition and experience rather than on the knowledge rich data hidden in the data set and databases. This practice leads to unwanted biases, errors and excessive medical costs which affects the quality of service provided to patients. 

Data mining holds great potential for the healthcare industry to enable health systems to systematically use data and analytics to identify inefficiencies and best practices that improve successful application of data mining in highly visible fields like e-business, marketing and retail has led to its application in other industries and sectors.

# Scope:
Here the scope of the project is that integration of clinical decision support with computer-based patient records could reduce medical errors, enhance patient safety, decrease unwanted practice variation, and improve patient outcome. This suggestion is promising as data modeling and analysis tools, e.g., data mining, have the potential to generate a knowledge-rich environment which can help to significantly improve the quality of clinical decisions
